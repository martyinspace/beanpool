## 1. Overview

BeanPool operates a **mutual credit** system. There is no money supply. When Alice pays Bob 40 Ʀ, Alice goes to −40 and Bob goes to +40. The network always sums to zero. Credit is not pre-created — it is issued the moment a trade happens, backed by the community's trust in the participants.

The rules in this document exist to answer three questions:

1. **How much can someone borrow?** → The Dynamic Credit Floor.
2. **How much can someone save?** → The Dynamic Credit Ceiling.
3. **How do we stop cheating?** → Anti-Sybil Defences.

---

## 2. The Bean (Ʀ)

The Bean is the unit of account. It is not pegged to any fiat currency. It has no intrinsic value — its value comes from the community's agreement to accept it in exchange for real goods and services.

- Symbol: **Ʀ** (or 🫘 in informal contexts)
- Precision: 2 decimal places
- Supply: None. The network sum is always zero.

---

## 3. Reference Rate

To help participants understand the value of a Bean, the protocol defines a **reference rate**:

> **40 Ʀ = 1 hour of community time**

This is not a price floor or ceiling for labour — it is a shared reference point for intuition. A skilled tradesperson might charge 60–80 Ʀ per hour; a bag of lemons might be 3 Ʀ. The reference rate simply anchors the mental model.

### Pricing Guide

| Item | Suggested Price | Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ☕ Coffee | 5 Ʀ | ~8 minutes of community time |
| 🍋 Bag of lemons | 3–5 Ʀ | Small market goods |
| 🧹 General labour (1 hour) | 25–40 Ʀ | Basic community help |
| 🔧 Average skilled work (1 hour) | 40 Ʀ | The reference anchor |
| 🪚 Specialist trade (1 hour) | 60–80 Ʀ | Premium skills |
| 📅 Full day's work | 250–320 Ʀ | Significant commitment |
| 🏠 Major project | 500–2000 Ʀ | Requires deep community trust |

### Hour Equivalent Display

Throughout the app, all bean amounts display an approximate time equivalent:
- `5 Ʀ (≈ 8min)`
- `40 Ʀ (≈ 1hr)`
- `320 Ʀ (≈ 8hr)`

This helps participants intuitively grasp the value of any price, balance, or credit limit.

---

## 4. Mutual Credit

Every member has a **balance** that can be positive (they are owed value) or negative (they owe value to the community).

- A **positive balance** means you have provided more goods/services than you have received. The community owes you.
- A **negative balance** means you have received more than you have provided. You owe the community.
- The sum of all balances in the network is always **zero**.

Balances are bounded by two limits:
- The **floor** — how far negative you can go (your borrowing power).
- The **ceiling** — how far positive you can go before soft penalties apply.

---

## 5. Dynamic Credit Floor (Borrowing Limit)

The credit floor is **not a fixed number**. It grows dynamically based on the member's trade history. A brand new account has a small credit line. An established, active trader has a large one.

### The Formula

```
floor = BASE_FLOOR − min(MAX_EARNED, earnedCredit)

where:
  earnedCredit = (tradeCount × 8) + (uniquePartners × 40) + (accountAgeDays × 2)
```

- **BASE_FLOOR:** −80 Ʀ (the starting credit for a new account)
- **MAX_EARNED:** 1920 Ʀ (the maximum additional credit that can be earned)
- **Total cap:** −2000 Ʀ (BASE_FLOOR + MAX_EARNED = 80 + 1920)

### What counts

| Factor | Weight | Why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Each completed trade | +8 Ʀ of credit | Proves economic activity |
| Each unique trade partner | +40 Ʀ of credit | Proves diverse connections (not wash-trading) |
| Each day of account age | +2 Ʀ of credit | Proves sustained presence |

### What does NOT count

- Trades with `escrow_*` system wallets (these are internal accounting)
- Self-transactions
- Cancelled or refunded trades

### Progression Examples

| Scenario | Trades | Partners | Age (days) | Floor | ≈ Hours of credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Brand new member | 0 | 0 | 0 | **−80 Ʀ** | 2 hours |
| First week | 3 | 2 | 7 | **−198 Ʀ** | 5 hours |
| One month active | 10 | 5 | 30 | **−420 Ʀ** | 10.5 hours |
| Three months | 30 | 12 | 90 | **−900 Ʀ** | 22.5 hours |
| Six months | 60 | 20 | 180 | **−1720 Ʀ** | 43 hours |
| One year veteran | 150 | 30 | 365 | **−2000 Ʀ** | 50 hours (capped) |

### Key Principle

The credit floor represents **the community's trust in you**, measured by your history. You cannot buy trust. You cannot fake it with a single trading partner. You earn it through sustained, diverse, organic participation.

---

## 6. Dynamic Credit Ceiling (Saving Limit)

The credit ceiling is **twice the absolute value of the floor**. This is an asymmetric design:

```
ceiling = |floor| × 2
```

| Floor | Ceiling |
| :--- | :--- |
| −80 Ʀ | +160 Ʀ |
| −420 Ʀ | +840 Ʀ |
| −2000 Ʀ | +4000 Ʀ |

### Why asymmetric?

- A **negative balance** is a liability to the community. If someone at −2000 disappears, the community absorbs that loss.
- A **positive balance** is stored goodwill. If someone at +4000 disappears, *they* lost out — the community is unaffected.

It is therefore safe (and fair) to let productive members accumulate more than they can borrow.

### What happens above the ceiling?

The ceiling is a **soft cap**, not a hard wall. Members can exceed the ceiling, but balances above the ceiling are subject to **accelerated demurrage** (see Section 8). This creates gentle economic pressure to spend, donate, or invest excess beans — without hard-blocking someone in the middle of a productive streak.

---

## 7. Identity Tiers

Every member's tier is determined automatically by their dynamic credit floor. Tiers are cosmetic labels that communicate trust level at a glance. They also gate certain capabilities.

| Tier | Condition | Colour | Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ghost** 👻 | floor > −200 Ʀ | Gray | Marketplace escrow trades only. No direct transfers. **Cannot invite new members.** |
| **Resident** 🏠 | −200 ≥ floor > −600 Ʀ | Blue | Full access. Direct transfers unlocked. Can invite new members. |
| **Citizen** 🏛️ | −600 ≥ floor > −1400 Ʀ | Purple | Full access. |
| **Elder** 👑 | floor ≤ −1400 Ʀ | Amber | Full access. |

### Ghost Restrictions

Ghosts are new, unproven accounts. To protect the community:

1. **Marketplace only** — Ghosts can trade through the marketplace escrow system (buy and sell goods/services), but cannot send direct ledger transfers (gifts).
2. **Cannot invite** — Ghosts cannot generate invitation codes. This prevents puppet chains (see Section 10).

These restrictions lift automatically when the member's organic trade history grows enough to reach Resident tier.

---

## 8. Community Circulation (Value Decay)

Community Circulation is a small periodic reduction applied to **positive balances**. It prevents hoarding and returns idle beans to the community Commons Pool — keeping the local economy flowing like healthy blood circulation.

> **Why "Community Circulation"?** Positive balances represent value you've earned but haven't yet spent locally. Circulation gently encourages that stored value to flow back into the community — funding projects, rewarding neighbours, and keeping the economy alive.

### Standard Circulation

- **Rate:** 0.5% per month
- **Epoch:** Applied every 30 days
- **Applies to:** Positive balances only (you don't pay circulation on debt)
- **Destination:** Circulated beans flow to the community Commons Pool

### Accelerated Circulation (Above Ceiling)

Balances that exceed the member's dynamic ceiling are subject to **5× the standard rate**:

- **Rate:** 2.5% per month (on the portion above the ceiling)
- **Purpose:** Soft pressure to circulate excess beans — donate to projects, tip community members, or invest in community infrastructure
- **UI Display:** "You are 160 Ʀ above your soft cap. In 4 days, ≈4 Ʀ will flow to the Community Fund to encourage local trade."

### Example

A Citizen with a ceiling of +840 Ʀ holds a balance of +1000 Ʀ:
- First 840 Ʀ circulates at 0.5%/month = −4.20 Ʀ
- Remaining 160 Ʀ (above ceiling) circulates at 2.5%/month = −4.00 Ʀ
- Total monthly circulation: −8.20 Ʀ → Commons Pool

---

## 9. Invitations

BeanPool is an invite-only network. Membership requires an invitation code from an existing member.

### Who can invite?

- **Ghost** 👻 → **Cannot invite.** Must reach Resident tier first.
- **Resident** 🏠 → Can invite. No hard limit on number.
- **Citizen** 🏛️ → Can invite. No hard limit.
- **Elder** 👑 → Can invite. No hard limit.
- **Node Admin** → Can generate standard and elevated invites (see below).

### Why Ghosts can't invite

This single rule breaks **puppet chain attacks**. If a bad actor creates a puppet account, that puppet is a Ghost. Ghosts can't invite. So the puppet can't create more puppets. The attack terminates at generation one.

To earn invitation privileges, a member needs real trades with real, unique partners — proving they are an engaged participant, not a bot.

### Admin Genesis Invites (Tiered Bootstrap)

The node admin has access to **tiered invite codes** from the `/settings` panel. These allow the admin to bootstrap trusted, known community members at an elevated starting tier — bypassing the Ghost restrictions.

| Invite Type | Starting Tier | Starting Floor | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard** | Ghost 👻 | −80 Ʀ | Default for all regular invites |
| **Trusted** | Resident 🏠 | −200 Ʀ | Known community members. Can invite + gift immediately. |
| **Ambassador** | Citizen 🏛️ | −600 Ʀ | Market promoters, community organisers. Full capabilities from day one. |

**Rules:**
- Only the **node admin** can generate Trusted and Ambassador invites. Regular members always generate Standard (Ghost-level) invites.
- The elevated tier is a **starting position**, not a permanent grant. The member's floor still follows the dynamic formula — but their `earnedCredit` is pre-seeded to place them at the correct tier threshold.
- Elevated invites are **visible in the Invitation Tree** with a special badge, providing full transparency.
- This mechanism exists because the admin is the root of trust for the node. If the admin vouches for someone as a known community pillar, forcing them through 3 months of Ghost-tier restrictions is counterproductive.

### Invitation Tree

Every invitation creates a parent→child relationship. The full tree is visible to node admins and provides accountability: you can trace any member back to who invited them, and who invited *that* person, all the way to the node genesis.

### Invitation Health

Each inviter's "tree health" is tracked and visible on their profile:

- **Invited:** Total number of people invited
- **Active:** How many have completed at least one trade (with someone other than the inviter)
- **Graduated:** How many have reached Resident tier
- **Defaulted:** How many went to their floor and became inactive

This is informational, not punitive. An enthusiastic inviter who brings in 20 people but only 5 engage is doing community outreach — not cheating. The data just provides transparency.

### Market Stall Scenario

A Citizen at a farmers market wants to onboard 50 new members:
1. They generate invite codes (or a bulk QR sheet)
2. People scan and sign up → all start as Ghosts
3. Each Ghost can immediately participate in the marketplace (buy and sell via escrow)
4. Those who engage naturally progress through the tiers
5. Those who never trade sit at balance 0 → harmless, zero cost to the community

---

## 10. Anti-Sybil Defences

A **Sybil attack** is when a bad actor creates multiple fake identities to extract value. In BeanPool, the most dangerous form is: create a puppet account → extract its full credit line → abandon the puppet → repeat.

BeanPool does not use KYC (Know Your Customer). Instead, it uses **KYH (Know Your History)** — making the cost of building a trusted identity higher than the reward of attacking with a fake one.

### Three Defence Layers

| Layer | Rule | What it prevents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Ghosts can't gift** | New accounts can only transact through marketplace escrow. Direct transfers are blocked. | Instant, invisible draining of credit. |
| **2. Ghosts can't invite** | New accounts cannot generate invitation codes. | Puppet chains — one puppet creating more puppets. |
| **3. Diverse partner requirement** | Credit only grows with unique trade partners, not trade volume with one person. | Wash-trading to inflate trust. |

### Attack Scenario Analysis

**Attack:** Eve (Resident) creates 5 puppet accounts, each with −80 Ʀ floor.

| Step | What happens |
| :--- | :--- |
| Eve creates 5 puppets | Each is a Ghost with −80 Ʀ floor |
| Puppets try to gift beans to Eve | **Blocked** — Ghosts can't do direct transfers |
| Eve lists fake services, puppets "buy" through marketplace | Possible, but visible: 5 escrow trades, all same seller, all same time frame |
| Each puppet goes to −80 and disappears | Max damage: 5 × 80 = 400 Ʀ |
| Puppets try to create more puppets | **Blocked** — Ghosts can't invite |
| Eve's invitation tree shows 5 defaulted invitees | Visible to the community — reputational cost |

**Result:** The attack is capped at 400 Ʀ (10 hours of community time), requires visible marketplace activity, is self-terminating (puppets can't chain), and leaves a permanent trail on Eve's profile. Compare this to an undefended system where the same attacker could drain unlimited credit silently.

### The Economics of Honesty

The system is designed so that **being a good community member is always more profitable than cheating**:

| Path | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| Trade honestly for 3 months | −900 Ʀ credit line, +1800 Ʀ ceiling, Citizen status, invitation privileges, community reputation |
| Create 5 puppets | 400 Ʀ extracted (one-time), Ghost status on puppets (can't chain), visible on invitation tree, no more puppets possible |

---

## 11. Marketplace & Escrow

The marketplace is the primary venue for economic activity. All trades between members go through an **escrow handshake**.

### Escrow Flow

1. **Offer/Need posted** → visible to community
2. **Counterparty accepts** → beans are locked in an `escrow_*` system wallet
3. **Goods/services delivered** → both parties confirm
4. **Escrow releases** → beans transfer from buyer to seller

### Escrow Wallet Exemptions

Escrow wallets (`escrow_*`) are **system-managed accounts**, not human credit lines. They are exempt from:
- Dynamic credit floor
- Dynamic credit ceiling
- Demurrage

---

## 12. Transaction Guardrails

### Spending Warning

When a transaction would use more than **50% of the sender's remaining credit line**, the app displays a warning:

```
⚠️ This uses 76% of your available credit.
After this trade you'll have 100 Ʀ of credit remaining.
```

This is informational — it does not block the trade.

### Ghost Transfer Block

If a Ghost-tier account attempts a direct ledger transfer (not a marketplace escrow trade), the transfer is rejected with a message:

```
Build trust through marketplace trades to unlock direct transfers.
Your current tier: Ghost 👻
Progress to Resident: [▓▓▓░░░░░░░] 34%
```

### Hour Equivalent Context

Every transaction confirmation shows the amount in both beans and time:

```
Send 320 Ʀ to @CaptainBean?
≈ 8 hours of community time

Your balance after: +60 Ʀ (≈ 1.5hr)
```

---

## 13. Achievements

Achievements are **earned badges** displayed on a member's profile. They are derived from existing data — no additional user action is required.

| Achievement | Condition | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🤝 **First Trade** | 1 completed trade | Welcome to the community |
| 🏘️ **Local Hero** | 10+ unique trade partners | Well-connected community member |
| ⚖️ **Reciprocity Champion** | Send/receive ratio between 0.7 and 1.3 | Balanced giver and receiver |
| 🌱 **Node Anchor** | Invited 5+ members who became active | Growing the community |
| 🛡️ **Guardian Angel** | Set 3 or more guardians | Secured their sovereign identity |
| 🎖️ **Veteran** | Account age ≥ 365 days | A year of community participation |
| 💝 **Generous** | Donated to 3+ community projects | Supporting community initiatives |

---

## 14. Federation

When BeanPool nodes connect as **peers**, they form a federated network. The protocol rules in this document are **protocol-level constants** — they are the same on every node. This prevents arbitrage attacks where a member exploits different rules on different nodes.

### What is shared across nodes

- Credit formula and weights
- Demurrage rate and epoch
- Tier thresholds
- Reference rate

### What is local to each node

- Community name and branding
- Admin contact information
- Marketplace posts
- Member balances and transaction history (synced via Merkle exchange)

### Federation Verification

When a transfer occurs across federated nodes, both nodes independently calculate the sender's dynamic floor using the protocol formula. If the transfer would exceed the floor, it is rejected. This prevents a compromised node from allowing over-limit transfers.

---

## 15. Protocol Constants

All values are defined in `beanpool-core/src/protocol.ts` and are identical across all nodes in the network.
