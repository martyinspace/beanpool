# BeanPool Native App

> Full-featured React Native / Expo companion app — achieving visual and functional parity with the BeanPool PWA.

---

## Purpose

The BeanPool Native App is a **full native client** for Android and iOS, built with Expo Router and React Native. It mirrors the PWA's tab-based interface with native UI controls, SQLite-backed data persistence, and Expo SecureStore for identity management. A background sync service (Pillar Toggle) periodically mirrors the community ledger via Merkle delta exchange.

## Tabs

| Tab | Emoji | Screen | Purpose |
|-----|-------|--------|---------|
| Map | 🗺️ | `index.tsx` | Community map with pre-rendered markers + clustering (Google Maps native) |
| Projects | 🌱 | `projects.tsx` | Community crowdfunding — propose and fund shared goals with Beans |
| Market | 🤝 | `market.tsx` | 14-category marketplace — grid/list view, search, category filter, block users |
| Chat | 💬 | `chats.tsx` | DM and group conversations |
| People | 👥 | `people.tsx` | Community member browser |
| Ledger | 📊 | `ledger.tsx` | Mutual credit balance, transaction history, send credits |
| Settings | ⚙️ | `settings.tsx` | Profile editing, node config, identity management (hidden from tab bar) |

## Key Features

- **Self-Managed Identity & E2E Encryption** — Ed25519 keypair from BIP-39 12-word mnemonic, stored securely in hardware-backed Expo SecureStore. Direct messages are fully E2E encrypted (Noise/X25519/AES-GCM) protecting user chats from server visibility (NAT-1), with sent/read receipts and encrypted camera/photo attachments.
- **SQLite Post Context Caching** — Metadata (titles, status, cover photos, credits) is cached in local SQLite `conversations` and `marketplace_transactions` tables. This guarantees transaction histories and active chats display correct titles and photos when restoring/migrating accounts on a new phone.
- **Review Editing** — Option to edit reviews directly from the Given tab of a profile, with pre-populated stars and comments inside the `ReviewModal`.
- **Android Memory Optimization** — Configured `largeHeap: true` to prevent Out-of-Memory (OOM) heap limit crashes during dense image handling or map rendering.
- **Official App & Play Store Update Checks** — Querying unauthenticated store APIs (iTunes Lookup for iOS, regex parsing of Play details HTML scripts for Android) on a 24-hour throttled check, showing an organic header upgrade banner decoupled from node updates.
- **Decoupled Release Versioning** — Support for individual native-only bumps (`node scripts/bump-version.mjs patch --native`) and Git tags (`native-v*`), decoupling review times from server nodes.
- **Real-time Node Parity Settings** — Displaying sync status indicators (`🟢 Synced`, `⚠️ Out of Sync`, `⚪ Offline / Local-First`) under SQLite cache details by querying table aggregates against live remote transactions, posts, and member sizes.
- **SQLite Integrity Diagnostics (v1.0.83 / v1.0.84)** — Active `PRAGMA integrity_check` scans, database file size display, and multi-table counters (Members, Posts, DMs, Txns) displaying database health indicators in Settings. Includes Koa health check `minAppVersion` gates matched dynamically on client boot to overlay updates.
- **Client-Side Request Signing** — Signs requests natively using Ed25519 for all signature-required API routes (including profile update, ledger transfer, marketplace posts/deals, friends add/remove, set guardian, push token registration, and notification preferences).
- **SQLite Persistence** — all posts, projects, messages, and ledger data stored locally via `expo-sqlite`
- **14-Category Marketplace** — Food, Services, Labour, Tools, Goods, Housing, Transport, Education, Arts, Health, Care, Animals, Energy, General (PWA has 13; native adds Care ❤️)
- **Marketplace UX Modernization** — horizontal category chips via `CategoryPickerSheet`, author trust badges (`PostAuthorTrust`), and active deals tracking (`MyDealsSheet`)
- **Author Request Review Flow** — Enhanced deals management allowing sellers to review buyer requests with integrated messaging and standardized decline reasons
- **Ledger UI Enhancements** — Corrected credit slider visual representation for negative balances and improved feedback for locked 'Send Credits' functionality
- **Map Clustering (Phase 6)** — pin clustering for dense areas, modern markers with category icons, elder glow effects for founding members
- **Map Clustering Stabilization** — Patched `react-native-map-clustering` to prevent marker disappearance on iOS scroll/zoom
- **Android Marker Pipeline** — All map pins and clusters are pre-rendered to PNG via `react-native-view-shot` and served through the Google Maps `BitmapDescriptor` pipeline (`image={{ uri }}` prop), bypassing Android's restrictive JSX bitmap snapshot window. Cluster counts are pre-rendered for 2–99 with a "99+" overflow pattern for high-density areas.
- **Profile Navigation** — Author names and avatars are tappable across all marketplace surfaces (cards, map preview, community list, projects), navigating to the Trust Profile page with correct data params
- **Offline Outbox** — Native SQLite capability allowing users to draft and queue marketplace posts whilst offline, with automatic syncing upon reconnection
- **Sanitized Syncing** — The native SQLite `applyDelta` daemon and map automatically filter out synthetic visitor/guest accounts and escrow wallets
- **Push Notifications** — DM and marketplace deal alerts via Expo Push, per-member notification preferences, token registration
- **Guest Mode** — multi-node onboarding flow with membership probe; guest indicators in header and sync status when visiting a node you're not a member of
- **Community Search** — search and infinite scroll on the Community member list
- **App Store & Play Store Submission** — Published/built for both stores (v1.1.29, Android versionCode 143, iOS build 131).
- **Community Projects** — crowdfund tab with progress bars, funding badges, and proposal creation
- **Branded Tab Bar** — neon-vine artwork background with semi-transparent overlay
- **Post Detail View** — full-screen view with photos, credits, author info
- **Global Notifications** — red tab bar badges dynamically map to internal SQLite `last_read_at` unread calculations across inactive threads
- **Live Thread Syncing** — optimized 3-second polling hooks inside Active Chat fragments safely establish WebSocket-like responsiveness without hammering the background Node, paired with a `sync_data_updated` DeviceEventEmitter listener to reload chat details and message logs in real-time.
- **SQLite Concurrency Mutex** — robust `dbSyncLock` javascript queue and zero-lock network fetches guarantee zero memory locks and prevent "database is locked" crashes when background `applyDelta` daemons inherently overlap with foreground UX reads
- **Local User Blocking** — client-side block list stored in SecureStore securely hides target callsigns and listings
- **Settings Visual Overhaul** — identity card with bio, contact details, and contrast improvements
- **iOS Crypto Polyfill** — SHA-512 and Ed25519 signing polyfilled for iOS via `expo-crypto`
- **Escrow Actions** — request/approve/reject/cancel/complete marketplace deals with atomic escrow settlement
- **Social Recovery (3-of-N)** — cryptographically secure identity recovery requiring a quorum of trusted guardians without central admins.
- **Quadratic Voting** — native governance engine with voting stepper, dual progress bars, and CommonsInfoModal for community projects.
- **Haptic Feedback** — contextual haptic responses for a tactile and responsive native experience.
- **Cross-platform Avatar Sync** — robust `bundled://` protocol for seamless avatar resolution and cross-platform syncing.

## Background Sync (Pillar Toggle)

```
Every 15 min (iOS) / configurable (Android):
  1. Wake up in background
  2. Connect to BeanPool node
  3. Request node's Merkle root hash
  4. Compare with local hash
     → Match? Done. (0 bytes, ~1 second)
     → Differ? Pull delta only
  5. Apply delta, prune to 1,000 tx
  6. If > 20 seconds: checkpoint & abort
```

| Rule | Value | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Timeout** | 20 seconds | iOS kills tasks > 30s |
| **Pruning** | 1,000 transactions | Protect phone storage |
| **Checkpoint** | Auto | Resume aborted syncs |

## Deep Link & Onboarding Architecture

To gracefully bypass Apple and Google's URL parameter stripping during uninstalled app boundary crossings, BeanPool implements a 3-tier deep-link mitigation flow carefully balancing reliability and user privacy constraints.

1. **Deferred Deep Linking (Clipboard Inference)**
   - Apple strictly drops URL parameters if a user must install the app completely from scratch. 
   - We solve this by having the `WelcomePage.tsx` Web Trampoline inject `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` onto the "Download App Store" buttons.
   - Onboarding clipboard verification is now strictly user-initiated on the first boot via a styled "Paste" action. This resolved intrusive background clipboard scanning (`Clipboard.hasStringAsync()`) that flashed platform privacy/spyware warnings, completely eliminating background clipboard polling.

2. **Bypassing Expo Router Hydration Drops**
   - Relying on `useLocalSearchParams()` on Android leads to intent drops, as standard router hydration intrinsically races during cold-boot states, losing the `?invite=` query argument.
   - We forcefully bypass the router by having the Welcome screen natively pull `Linking.useURL()` on purely the first mount tick.

3. **Android Intent Parser Safe Payloads**
   - The Android Deep Link parser destructively munches standard Base64 characters (`+`, `/`, `=`) turning them into whitespace inside URL parameters.
   - Offline cryptographic tickets are entirely encoded in `Base64URL` natively by the PWA and safely reversed exactly before the backend triggers Ed25519 parsing. Invite formats are distinguished primarily by length (Tickets > 20 characters) and fallback legacy genesis codes (`INV-XXXX`).
